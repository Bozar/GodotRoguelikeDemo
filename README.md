This is a Roguelike demo made with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/) 3.2.1. The GUI font is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). The tileset, [curses_vector](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161328.0), is created by DragonDePlatino for Dwarf Fortress.

When the game starts, there is a square block of walls in the map center and three enemies appear at random positions. Press arrow keys to move PC. Wall blocks movement. Kill NPC by bumping. NPC sends a warning message when PC is nearby. There is an counter to show how many turns have passed since the game begins.
